<h1>What is Hack Keele?</h1>
<p>We're the computing society for Keele University, but we're not all computer science students.</p>
<p>Whether you're writing your first lines of HTML, building a VR app or even a hoverboard, Hack Keele is just the place for you!</p>
<p>We have workshops, game jams and hackathons to bring your ideas come to life and help you learn the many technologies that are used in the real world.</p>

		<h1 class="ArticleBoxHeader">Who can attend?</h1>
		<p>All of our sessions are free to enter! Hack Keele is a student-focused society, so the only prerequisite is that you are a current student, or have graduated in the last year.</p>
		<p>Despite us being a computer science focused society, you don't need to be studying it to join us!</p>

		<h1 class="ArticleBoxHeader">What skills do I need?</h1>
		<p><b>None!</b></p>
		<p>Everyone has to start somewhere! One of the awesome qualities of our socials is the sheer number of lovely people that you'll meet at them.</p>
		<p>Not everyone knows everything from the get-go, that's why we're here! But, if you're already skilled, we'll have things for you too!</p>
