		<h1 class="ArticleBoxHeader">Why should you sponsor us?</h1>
		<p>Students establish industry connections which not only create employment opportunities for the students, but it also puts a school on the radar of important donors and corporate partners.</p>
		<p>More importantly, countless students get to spend our workshops and hackathon weekend having fun, meeting new people, and preparing themselves for technical careers. Hackathons provide a real-world experience for students, as they compete in teams to create a product. Similar to the product cycles of a startup company, hackathon teams quickly transition from the idea stage to the final product.</p>
		<p>Students have a chance to gain time management skills, along with technical expertise and new connections. In addition, students get to spend one-on-one time with expert mentors who spend the hackathon teaching students new technical skills and helping students with their projects.</p>
